Included are some examples of agents that can be built using this package.

First, create a .`env` file with `SCRAPERAPI_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

The web browsing and Amazon search agents use Streamlit to create a Chatbot interface. To run them, first `pip install streamlit` and then launch using `streamlit run web_browsing_agent.py`.
